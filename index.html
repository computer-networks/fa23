        <p>
        15-441/641 is an introductory course in computer networks. The emphasis
        will be on the basic performance and engineering tradeoffs in the
        design and implementation of computer networks. To make the issues
        more concrete, the class includes several multi-week projects
        requiring significant design and implementation.
        </p>

        <p>
        The goal is for students to learn not only what computer networks are
        and how they work today, but also why they are designed the way they
        are and how they are likely to evolve in the future. We will draw
        examples primarily from the Internet. Topics to be covered include:
        congestion/flow/error control, routing, addressing, naming,
        multi-casting, switching, internetworking, and network
        security. Evaluation is based on homework assignments, the projects,
        one midterm exam, and one final exam.

<p> "Introduction to Computer Systems" is a
  prerequisite for the course.  It is offered under the following
  course numbers: 15-213, 18-213, and 15-513.  Graduate students must
  get a B to satisfy the prerequisite.  Students who have taken the
  prerequisite course at CMU get priority when we move students from
  the waiting list.  </p>
<p> Once students who meet the prerequisites
  have been cleared, we will consider students with a strong systems
  background. These decisions will be made in the first or second week
  of the semester.  Do not send mail to the instructors about this
  (e.g., explaining your background) - it will not help your case.
